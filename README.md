# Year in Books
Repository for Year In Books website

## Technical stuff
This is my _first_ github repository.

What you see here is all the vanilla html and css used to build [yearinbooks](www.yearinbooks.com). I am using visual code as my editor, Github desktop to commit changes and Netlify to deploy my website. Use this repository to build your own year in books / movies / whatever and let me know if you have comments or questions! 

## Project details
YearInBooks is a public shelf of the books I have read this year. The stats above are from Goodreads and the ‘review’ format is inspired by little index cards found in independent bookstores. This page gives me a forum to showcase what I read and summarize notes from them. 

I have more plans to learn through this project but let me not get ahead of myself :)
